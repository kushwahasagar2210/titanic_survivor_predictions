# Titanic Survival Predictor 🚢

## 📌 Overview
The **Titanic Survival Predictor** is a machine learning project that analyzes passenger data from the Titanic dataset to predict whether a passenger would survive or not.  
It demonstrates end-to-end data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation on a real-world dataset.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle Titanic Dataset]  
- Files used:
  - `titanic_train.csv`
  - `titanic_test.csv`

## ⚙️ Approach
1. **Data Cleaning** – handled missing values and inconsistent data.  
2. **Feature Engineering** – transformed categorical features, extracted new features like *Family Size*.  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – visualized key factors (Age, Gender, Passenger Class, Fare).  
4. **Model Training** – applied Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree.  
5. **Evaluation** – compared accuracy and selected the best model.

## 📈 Results
- Achieved *85% accuracy** on the test dataset.  
- Important survival indicators:
  - Gender (females had higher survival probability)
  - Passenger Class (higher classes had better survival rates)
  - Fare (higher fare correlated with higher survival chances)
